Things Kingsley will do

Relative abundance of colonies by flow type (inflow vs. outflow).
Relative abundance of colonies by antibiotics.
Combined abundance of colonies by flow type and antibiotics (stacked or grouped).
Interpretation
Inflow vs. Outflow: This will show whether the colony abundance is higher in the inflow or the outflow of your sample.

Antibiotic Comparison: You will observe which antibiotic showed higher or lower bacterial counts, reflecting relative resistance or susceptibility.

Combined abundance: This will show a detailed breakdown of colony abundance for each antibiotic within inflow and outflow categories.

Note, Kingsley is excluding the colonies in a  lawn becaause  a lawn contains infinity number of colonies

# Materials & Methods, Ruby

## Set chunk options
Formatted display of content from .md file on GitHub site.
Upon knitr figures will be saved to 'Figs/'
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, message = FALSE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path='Figs/')
```

## Load packages
```{r packages, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) #core packages from Tidyverse
library(googledrive) #access to GoogleDrive
library(googlesheets4) #access to GoogleSheets
##library(data.table) #fast data handling;  complement to tidverse dplyr
##library(lubridate) #tidyverse handling dates & times
library(knitr)
library(ggmap) #tools for using maps from GoogleEarth & GoogleMaps
```

## InLine Citations of software packages added through the 'citr' option under 'Addins'.  
The cited items must be in the .bib file saved in the .Rproj folder; in this case RPackageCitations.bib, generated by exporting a library to .bib from Zotero.  Upon export click the 'Keep Updated' button in the BetterBibTex menu.  If new citations are added to Zotero they will be pushed through to update the exported .bib file in the .Rproj folder.

## Source locally saved functions stored in a text file
A text file of functions is a preliminary step towards a package, to re-use functions without repasting them.



## Set Project Variables  
Try to set all user-defined variables near top of .Rmd, in one place, to avoid or limit editing of downstream code.
Assigning project-specific values to generic variables helps with re-use of code.



# Import MetaData from a GoogleSheet
MetaData in a GoogleSheet is more generic than a project-specific .csv edited and saved locally.
The GoogleSheet interface can be tricky.
Repeatedly reading from GoogleDrive can provoke a throttle from Google.
```{r load Catalog direct from googlesheet, results = "hide"}


#Instead of sending a token, googlesheets4 will send an API key. This can be used to access public resources for which no Google sign-in is required. 
googlesheets4::gs4_deauth()



#URL or ID of a GoogleSheet readable by anyone (with a link)
MetaData <- googlesheets4::read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J6Ip_VzQCpMvZSZFiQVm0LSXW6wn2uSi7_NohkacjJ0/edit?gid=0#gid=0", sheet = "MetaData")

DataSheet <- googlesheets4::read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J6Ip_VzQCpMvZSZFiQVm0LSXW6wn2uSi7_NohkacjJ0/edit?gid=0#gid=0", sheet = "Data")
  # googlesheets4::read_sheet has a  "feature" to set the type of columns it can't parse to a list.
  # ggplot/dplyr does not like working with a dataframe of lists.
  # In this case variable column WL is set to a list since some values are numbers, some are strings, some are blank.
  # To fix this, first drop all rows missing WL, then unlist.
  # Must first drop NA rows since unlist will collapse NULL lists, then the unlisted WL is a shorter length than original WL column, which mutate does not like.
   #same link, updated data in it


#Catalog <- as.data.frame(Catalog) %>%
  #mutate(ExpDate = lubridate::ymd(ExpDate))
```
# Merged  DataSheet with MetaData by the value of PlateID
```{r merging DataSheet with MetaData by the value of PlateID}
DataMeta <- left_join(x  = DataSheet, y = MetaData, by = "PlateID")
```
## In-Lab Work 
We adapted protocols from Szybalski and Bryson (1952) and Lui *et al.* (2011) for an antibiotic gradient agar plates.
3 samples from inflows and 3 samples from outflows of the water fowl park water body were collected. 

```{r generate map}
## Load a map of Tantramar from GoogleMaps 
## https://www.littlemissdata.com/blog/maps  

register_google(key = "AIzaSyCJh3QpO7SbxKsJzjXo0qpAnJfVGJ_JPmg")

# create a map covering the areas we sampled
MaxLat <- max(MetaData$Lat, na.rm = TRUE)
MinLat <- min(MetaData$Lat, na.rm = TRUE)
MaxLon <- max(MetaData$Lon, na.rm = TRUE)
MinLon <- min(MetaData$Lon, na.rm = TRUE)
CentreLat = mean(MetaData$Lat, na.rm = TRUE)
CentreLon = mean(MetaData$Lon, na.rm = TRUE)

SackvilleMap <- get_googlemap(center = c(lon = CentreLon, lat = CentreLat),
                    zoom = 16,
                    scale = 2,
                    maptype ='satellite',
                    color = 'color')

ggmap(SackvilleMap)

```
```{r overlap sampling locations}
ggmap(SackvilleMap) +
 geom_point(data = MetaData, aes(x = Lon, y = Lat, colour = InOut), size = 3)  +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("In" = "darkslategray3", "Out" = "#e0115f"), na.translate = FALSE) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
labs(title = "Sampling Locations in Sackville Waterfowl Park",
              caption = "October, 2024")
```
 
1 mL of each sample was cultured on three antibiotic gradient plates with the tryptic soy agar and antibiotic (streptomycin, ampicillin, kanamycin) gradient ranging from 0-10 mg/mL. The incubated plates, inoculated on October 23, were left at room temperature and images were taken on October 25, October 28, and October 29.

Ideally, the antibiotic gradient plates serve as their own control since at one end, the concentration of the antibiotic being zero (Weinberg, 1959). *E. coli* was used as a control.


```{r}
# Relative abundance for FlowType and Antibiotic
 flow_antibiotic_relative <- DataMeta %>%
filter(!is.na(InOut))%>%
  group_by(Antibiotic, InOut)%>%
    summarise(TotalCount = sum(Colony_Number, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()
                               
                               
       #                        , .by = c() , ))%>%
     #mutate(RelativeAbundance = (TotalCount / sum(TotalCount)) * 100)
```

```{r}
flow_antibiotic_relative %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_bar(aes(x = Antibiotic, y = TotalCount, colour = InOut, fill = InOut ), stat = "identity")
```

# Discussion, Ruby
## Ampicillin Trends
Unlike the other antibiotics, very little diversity is seen in Ampicillin, no matter the location of the water sample.
The cream/yellow microbes may have already been resistant to Ampicillin, allowing them to outcomplete other microbes in the water sample, or there may have been less resistance of the other microbes to Ampicillin, allowing the cream/yellow microbes to propagate without competition. The darkening of colour of the cream/rust gradient over time looks to be the microbe drying out, since it doesn't further move along the antibiotic gradient after October 28.

# Results and Discussion, Avery

Analyzing the fungi growing on the plates qualitatively

Background Research:

Fungi are naturally resistant to antibiotics that kill commensal bacteria (which are those naturally occuring in/on the body), and therefore when antibiotics are used there is an increased likelihood of fungal infections (Jiang et al., 2017). With less bacterial growth, there would be more resources available to the fungi. The antibiotics that we tested (ampicillin, kanamycin, streptomycin) all kill commensal bacteria. This would imply that the more bacteria growing on a plate, the less fungal growth would be observed. 

In our experiment, a lot of fungal growth was observed. This could be from contamination during innoculation, but could also be from the presence of spores in the water samples. 

With this arises the question of whether bacterial or fungal infections are more harmful to ones health, and this really depends on the type of bacteria and fungus present. In a study by Khan et. al. (2024), there overall was higher mortality observed in ICU patients that developed fungal infections than those with bacterial infections. Again, these outcomes do vary greatly with the type of bacteria or fungus because some are more dangerous than others. We were unable to open these plates and identify the bacteria and fungi present because of the potential risk of them being harmful, so in this case we cannot say for sure whether or not the fungi and bacteria were dangerous. It is important to consider that when in contact with water like the samples from Waterfowl Park, Sackville NB, there is potential for both bacterial and fungal exposure. 

For ampicillin in particular, there are a lot of commensal bacteria that have built up resistance to the antibiotic due to its widespread use in medicine and agriculture (Gjonbalaj et. al., 2020). These bacteria have even been found to degrade ampicillin (Gjonbalaj et. al., 2020), and therefore theoretically this should lead to less fungal growth because there would be less antibiotic present and more commensal bacteria competing for the resources available in the plates. 

Taking a closer look at In3:

```{r Calling up Image for In3, October 28, 2024}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Documents/github/antibiotic_resistance/Data/Images/2024_10_28/IMG_2381.jpeg")
```

As can be seen in this image, all of the ampicillin plates exhibit more bacterial growth than the other antibiotic plates.There are also no fungi visible in the ampicillin plates, and there are fungi present in the kanamycin and streptomycin plates. 

Taking a closer look at Out3:

```{r Calling up Image for Out3, October 28, 2024}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Documents/github/antibiotic_resistance/Data/Images/2024_10_28/IMG_2394.jpeg")
```

A similar trend is observed in this image, in all of the ampicillin plates there are lawns of bacterial growth, and no fungi observed. In the kanamycin and streptomycin plates where less bacterial growth is observed, there is fungal growth in every plate. 

These results align with observations made by Jiang et al. (2017), showing that with increased bacterial growth there is less fungal growth. And, with antibiotics preventing bacterial growth there is more likelihood of fungal growth because fungi have natural antibiotic resistance and there is less competition for resources with bacteria if bacterial growth is lower. 

Fungi-Fungi Inhibition:

In our plates, there are some instances of fungi inhibiting other fungal growth, creating zones of inhibition.

For example:

```{r Calling up Image for In2, October 28, 2024}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Documents/github/antibiotic_resistance/Data/Images/2024_10_28/IMG_2375.jpeg")
```

In this image, you can see in the third streptomycin replicate (bottom right) that there is inibition of one fungi on the growth of another. The fluffy white fungus has grown around the circular, more beige fungus, leaving what can be described as a zone of inhibition between the two where there is no growth (edges of the two fungi do not extend and meet). 

```{r Calling up Image for Out1, October 29, 2024}}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Documents/github/antibiotic_resistance/Data/Images/2024_10_29/IMG_2400.jpeg")
```

In this image, the second and third streptomycin replicates (bottom row, middle and far right) also show fungi-fungi inhibition. There are similar zones of inhibition forming between different fungi growing on these plates. In the second streptomycin replicate, you can see the beige and white fungi will not extend and grow near each other (this image was from the last day of data collection so any extension that could have happened would have at this point), and in the third replicate a similar event can be seen with the beige fungus and the white fungi with green centres. 

Why does fungi-fungi inhibition occur?

Merging changes because of multiple working on project at once (version was behind)
