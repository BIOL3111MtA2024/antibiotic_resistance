# Overview of relative abundance analysis, Kingsley

Relative abundance of colonies by flow type (inflow vs. outflow).
Abundance of colonies by flow type and antibiotics (grouped).
Inflow vs. Outflow: This will show whether the colony abundance is higher in the inflow or the outflow of your sample.

Relative abundance for flowtype and antibiotic: This will show a detailed breakdown of colony abundance for each antibiotic within the inflow and outflow.

Note, Kingsley is excluding the colonies in a  lawn becaause  a lawn contains infinity number of colonies

# Introduction

Antibiotic resistance is a serious problem that is becoming more and more prevalent as the use and misuse of antibiotics increases. Widespread use of antibiotics in medicine has contributed to a rise in antibiotic resistance, and now with an increase in pollution from pharmaceuticals, there is the possibility of amplification of antibiotic resistance in the environment (Bondarczuk et. al., 2016). Antibiotics can enter the environment through pharmaceutical pollution of human and agricultural wastes, as well as from improper disposal of drugs. This experiment investigates if there is any differences in antibiotic resistance between the inflow and outflows present in Waterfowl Park, Sackville, NB. It is hypothesized that antibiotic resistance will be higher in strains found in the outflow samples due to possibility of amplification through conjugation.

## Import MetaData from a GoogleSheet
MetaData in a GoogleSheet is more generic than a project-specific .csv edited and saved locally.
The GoogleSheet interface can be tricky.
Repeatedly reading from GoogleDrive can provoke a throttle from Google.
```{r load Catalog direct from googlesheet, results = "hide"}


#Instead of sending a token, googlesheets4 will send an API key. This can be used to access public resources for which no Google sign-in is required. 
googlesheets4::gs4_deauth()



#URL or ID of a GoogleSheet readable by anyone (with a link)
MetaData <- googlesheets4::read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J6Ip_VzQCpMvZSZFiQVm0LSXW6wn2uSi7_NohkacjJ0/edit?gid=0#gid=0", sheet = "MetaData")

  # In this case variable column WL is set to a list since some values are numbers, some are strings, some are blank.
  # To fix this, first drop all rows missing WL, then unlist.
  # Must first drop NA rows since unlist will collapse NULL lists, then the unlisted WL is a shorter length than original WL column, which mutate does not like.

```

## In-Lab Work, Ruby
3 samples from inflows and 3 samples from outflows of the water fowl park water body were collected. 

```{r generate map}

Protocols from Szybalski and Bryson (1952) and Lui *et al.* (2011) were adapted to make antibiotic gradient agar plates. 

Antibiotics were water soluble, tryptic soy agar (TSA) was divided into 3 for the antibiotic mixtures before being sterilized in an autoclave, to ensure no contamination when splitting the TSA for the plain TSA and 3 antibiotic mixtures.

Ampicillin:
5.02 g ampicillin powder/500 mL TSA = 10.04 mg/mL

Due to lack of stock antibiotic powder, Kanamycin was made to the following specifications:
4.67 g kanamycin powder/500 mL TSA = 9.34 mg/mL

Streptomycin:
5 g streptomycin powder/500 mL = 10 mg/mL

Each 100 mm plate had 15 mL of the antibiotic agar added, then was tiled to an angle kept consistent using the edge of a scoopula. When cool and solidified, 15 mL of the tryptic soy agar was added to the diagonal antibiotic layer. Gradient plates were left to diffuse for 24 hours at room temperature.

1 mL of each sample was cultured on three antibiotic gradient plates with the tryptic soy agar and antibiotic (streptomycin, ampicillin, kanamycin) gradient ranging from 0 to ~10 mg/mL. 


The plates, inoculated on October 23, were left at room temperature and images were taken on October 25, October 28, and October 29.

Ideally, the antibiotic gradient plates serve as their own control since at one end the concentration of the antibiotic is zero (Weinberg, 1959). Lab strain *Escherichia coli* K12 was used as a control.

##Effective concentration 
The results present the average effective antibiotic concentration required to inhibit bacterial growth across three observation dates for the antibiotics Ampicilin, Kanamycin, and Streptomycin.
```{r}
avg_effective_conc <- DataMeta %>%
  filter(Colony_Number > 0) %>% # Include rows where colonies are present
  group_by(Antibiotic, ObservationDate) %>%
  summarize(
    Avg_Concentration = mean(AbxConcReached_mgmL, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
print(avg_effective_conc)
```
The average effective concentration of Ampicillin changes over the three observation datas, decreassing from 8.17 mg/mL (2024-10-25) to 6.66 mg/mL (2024-10-28) before increasing to 7.13 mg/mL (2024-10-29). The decrease in concentration on 2024-20-28 could suggest adaptive bacterial susceptibility to Ampicillin.
Kanamycin's effective concentration exhibits a gradual upward trend, increasing from 3.90 mg/mL (2024-10-25) to 5.06 mg/mL (2024-10-29). This consistent increase could indicate emerging bacterial resistance to Kanamycinover time. 
Streptomycin shows a slight increase in its effective concentration, from 6.25 mg/mL (2024-10-25) to 7.08 mg/mL (2024-10-28) followed by a decline to 6.84 (2024-10-29). the near plateau-like trend could suggest steady susceptibility with minimal resistance development.
The upward trends in Kanamycin and Streptomycin concentrations highlight a potential increase in resistance.
##Resistance threshold
The resistance threshold results indicate the minimum concentration of each antibiotic required to completely inhibit bacterial growth.
```{r}
resistance_threshold <- DataMeta %>%
  group_by(Antibiotic) %>%
  filter(Lawn_YesNo == "No" & Colony_YesNo == "No") %>%
  summarize(
    Resistance_Threshold = min(AbxConcReached_mgmL, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
print(resistance_threshold)
```
The results show that no antibiotics were successful in inhibiting the bacterial growth indicates a highly resistant bacterial population. 

##Comparison across antibiotics (to find the most effective antibiotic).
The results of the comparison of antibiotic effectiveness, excluding th NA group, are summarized in the following code/table, which includes the average colonony count and resistance threshold for each antibiotic tested.
```{r}
comparison <- DataMeta %>%
  group_by(Antibiotic) %>%
  summarize(
    Avg_ColonyCount = mean(Colony_Number, na.rm = TRUE), # Lower is better for effectiveness
    Resistance_Threshold = min(AbxConcReached_mgmL[Lawn_YesNo == "No" & Colony_YesNo == "No"], na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  arrange(Avg_ColonyCount)
print(comparison)
```
Ampicillin has an average colony count of 12.33, indicating some level of bacterial growth despite the presence of antibiotic. Streptomycin shows an average colony count of 14.51, while Kanamycin has the highert colony count at 16.69. Since lower colony counts suggest greater antibiotic effectiveness, these results indicate that Kanamycin was the least effective, followed by Streptomycin and Ampicillin. 
The results indicate that none of the antibiotics tested were able to completely inhibit bacterial growth at the concetrations tested. This suggest that the bacterial strains involved have developed substantial resistance, possibly through genetic mutations or horizontal gene transfer. The finding that all antibiotic tested failed to inhibit growth may indicate cross-resistance mechanism. Bacteria resistant to one antibiotic could have developed resistance to others with similar mechanisms of actions, rendering standard treatment options ineffective.

##Growth trends
The data presents an analysis of bacterial growth trends under varying conditions for three antibiotics, Ampicillin, Kanamycin and Streptomycin, classified by inflow or outflow.
```{r}
growth_trends <- DataMeta %>%
  group_by(Antibiotic, InOut) %>%
  summarize(
    Avg_ColonyCount = mean(Colony_Number, na.rm = TRUE),
    Avg_Concentration = mean(AbxConcReached_mgmL, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
print(growth_trends)
```
The drastic reduction in colony count in the "out" condition suggests that Ampicillin is more effective when the bacteria are exposed to an environment where they are removed from promoting conditions or may be under stress. This could indicate a conditional resistence mechanism that might involve environmental factors or the state of the bacteria. 

##Visualize growth trends
The plot visualizes the relationship between antibiotic concentration and colony count for different antibiotics, categorized by inflow or outflow. The scatter plot is overlaid with a smoothed line, which helps to visualize the general trend of bacterial growth in relationship to the antibiotic concentration, with seperatw plots for each antibiotic.
```{r}
ggplot(DataMeta, aes(x = AbxConcReached_mgmL, y = Colony_Number, color = InOut)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
  facet_wrap(~ Antibiotic) +
  labs(
    title = "Growth Trends: Colony Count vs Antibiotic Concentration",
    x = "Antibiotic Concentration",
    y = "Colony Count"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
For most antibiotics, as the antibiotic concentration increases, the colony count tends to decrease, indicating that higher concentrations of the antibiotic are generally more effective at inhibiting bacterial growth. This is expected as antibiotics typically have a dose-dependent effect.
The LOESS smoothed curves show a non-linear relationship, where at lower concentrations, bacteria tend to grow more, and at higher concentrations, colony counts drop. However, the relationship is not always perfectly linear, and the plot suggests potential plateau effects where increasing antibiotic concentration further does not result in additional colony inhibition.
The plot differentiates between the In and Out conditions with color coding. In many cases, the Out condition (which could represent a more controlled or stressed environment) tends to show lower colony counts at higher antibiotic concentrations, suggesting that the bacteria are more susceptible to the antibiotics when exposed in this manner.
The plot differentiates between the In and Out conditions with color coding. In many cases, the Out condition (which could represent a more controlled or stressed environment) tends to show lower colony counts at higher antibiotic concentrations, suggesting that the bacteria are more susceptible to the antibiotics when exposed in this manner.
Ampicillin trend: The trend for Ampicillin shows a clear decrease in colony counts with increasing concentration, particularly in the Out condition, indicating that Ampicillin is effective at inhibiting growth at higher concentrations. However, at very low concentrations, there is still significant bacterial growth in the In condition, which could indicate partial resistance or less effective exposure.
Kanamycin trend: The Kanamycin trend shows a less steep decline in colony count with increasing concentration, particularly in the In condition. This suggests that Kanamycin might be less effective in inhibiting growth at lower concentrations, and bacteria may exhibit partial resistance. The Out condition appears to show a slightly more defined decrease in colony count, but the trend is still not as sharp as with other antibiotics.
Streptomycin trend: Streptomycin shows an intermediate trend, where the colony count decreases with increasing antibiotic concentration, but the decline is not as pronounced as Ampicillin. The Out condition generally shows a more consistent decrease in colony count with increasing concentration, whereas the In condition exhibits more variation in growth despite the higher concentrations.
This visualization provides valuable insights into how bacterial growth responds to varying concentrations of antibiotics under different conditions. It suggests that antibiotic efficacy is influenced not only by the concentration but also by the inoculation condition, with some antibiotics showing stronger inhibition when bacteria are exposed in a stressed environment (Out condition). Moreover, non-linear trends, particularly the plateau effect at higher concentrations, indicate that bacterial resistance mechanisms may be at play. The findings emphasize the need for further investigation into the factors contributing to antibiotic resistance and highlight the importance of understanding how growth conditions influence bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics.

##Environmental impact 
The results show the average colony count for three different locations and their corresponding antibiotic treatments. This analysis helps assess the differential effectiveness of the antibiotics across these locations. The colony count is an indicator of bacterial growth, with lower counts generally suggesting higher effectiveness in inhibiting bacterial growth.
```{r}
location_effectiveness <- DataMeta %>%
  group_by(Location, Antibiotic) %>%
  summarize(
    Avg_ColonyCount = mean(Colony_Number, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
print(location_effectiveness)
```
The data reveals that antibiotic effectiveness varies significantly by location, emphasizing the importance of considering environmental and microbial factors when selecting antibiotics for treatment. Streptomycin appears to be the most effective in Location 2, while Ampicillin is more effective in Location 1. These results suggest that a tailored approach, based on location-specific antibiotic resistance patterns, could improve the success of antibiotic treatment strategies.

##Visualize environmental impact
The bar plot visualizes the average colony for the three antibiotics across three different locations, providing insight into how the environmental conditions at each location affect antibiotic effectiveness. The colony count is a measure of bacterial growth, with lower counts suggesting more effective inhibition by the antibiotic.
```{r}
ggplot(location_effectiveness, aes(x = Location, y = Avg_ColonyCount, fill = Antibiotic)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(
    title = "Environmental Impact on Antibiotic Effectiveness",
    x = "Location",
    y = "Average Colony Count"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

##Law presence
The correlation analysis provides insights into the relationship between antibiotic concentration and colony counts for the three antibiotics: Ampicillin, Kanamycin, and Streptomycin. The correlation values indicate the strength and direction of the linear relationship between these two variables, with higher positive correlations suggesting that higher antibiotic concentrations result in lower colony counts, indicating greater antibiotic effectiveness.
```{r}
law_relationship <- DataMeta %>%
  group_by(Antibiotic) %>%
  summarize(
    Correlation = cor(Colony_Number, AbxConcReached_mgmL, use = "complete.obs")
  )

print(law_relationship)

```
The correlation between Ampicillin concentration and colony count is 0.37, indicating a weak positive correlation. This suggests that as the concentration of Ampicillin increases, the colony count tends to increase slightly, which is an unexpected result given that higher antibiotic concentrations are typically associated with lower colony counts (indicating greater inhibition). This weak positive correlation may be influenced by factors such as bacterial resistance, inconsistent application of the antibiotic, or other environmental variables that hinder its effectiveness. Further investigation is needed to explore the underlying reasons for this trend.
Similar to Ampicillin, Kanamycin also exhibits a weak positive correlation of 0.38. This indicates that, like Ampicillin, increasing the concentration of Kanamycin has a minor tendency to result in higher colony counts, contrary to the expected outcome. This weak positive correlation could be attributed to bacterial resistance mechanisms that reduce the effectiveness of the antibiotic at higher concentrations, or it might suggest saturation effects, where beyond a certain concentration, the bacteria no longer respond to increased antibiotic levels.
The correlation for Streptomycin is even weaker, at 0.16, indicating a very weak positive correlation between antibiotic concentration and colony count. This suggests that the concentration of Streptomycin has an almost negligible effect on bacterial growth. In other words, regardless of the Streptomycin concentration, the bacterial colonies still show significant growth. This could indicate high bacterial resistance to Streptomycin, possibly due to the presence of resistant bacterial strains in the sample, or it could suggest that Streptomycin's effectiveness is limited under the experimental conditions used.
The weak positive correlations observed across all three antibiotics (Ampicillin, Kanamycin, and Streptomycin) indicate that higher antibiotic concentrations do not consistently result in lower colony counts, as would be expected in typical antibiotic efficacy testing. In fact, the results suggest that the bacteria might be exhibiting resistance mechanisms that reduce the effectiveness of increasing antibiotic concentrations.

##Visualize law relationship
The scatter plot with linear regression line provides a visual representation of the relationship between antibiotic concentration and colony count across different antibiotics. The graph usees antibiotic concentration on the x-axis and colony count on the y-axis, with points colored according to the antibiotic type. A linear regression line is superimposed to assess the overall trend of the data, excluding confidence intervals.

```

The inflow  has a higher relative abundance, accounting for approximately 60% of the total bacterial colony in the community.
The outflow shows a reduced relative abundance of about 40%, indicating a decrease in the proportion of resistant bacteria as water exits the waterfowl park.
The significant difference between the inlet and outlet indicates that the Sackville Waterfowl Park effectively reduces the relative abundance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The reduction suggests that natural processes such as sedimentation, microbial interactions, or dilution play a role in mitigating bacterial population as water moves through the park.
Despite the reduction, the outlet still contains a considerable proportion of resistant bacteria (~40%). This implies that, though the waterfowlpark does reduce bacterial abundance, it is not entirely effective, and additional measures may be needed to further decrease the bacterial population.

```

### Ampicillin.
 Ampicillin resistant bacteria are present at the inflow but are almost entirely absent by the time the water exits the park.This suggests that the Sackville Waterfowl Park is effective at reducing Ampicillin-resistant bacteria. Possible ways could be natural filtration through sediment, competition with other bacteria for nutrient which lead to a reduction in their population as water exit the park.
### Kanamycin 
Both the relative abundance of Inflow and Outflow quite are large, though the Outflow is slightly shorter. This suggest that there is the presence of Kanamycin-resistant bacteria in both the inflow and outflow of the waterfowl park. But the abundance is a little more pronounce at the inflow. This is somehow consistent with what we observed with Ampicillin.  The waterfowl park does a great job reducing the colony of bacteria at the inflow.
Although the Relative abundance decreases slightly in the outflow, a good number of Kanamycin-resistant bacteria remain, indicating that the park is less effective at reducing these resistant strains.
This may be due to the robustness of Kanamycin-resistant bacteria or the environmental factors that allow them to persist in the water.
### Streptomycin 
Shows the tallest bars in the graph, with the Inflow slightly taller than the Outflow.
Streptomycin-resistant bacteria are highly prevalent in both the inflow and outflow water.
But there is some reduction in resistance from the inflow to outflow, the persistence of high levels suggests that the waterfowl park is not very effective reducing the population of the Streptomycin-resistant bacteria.
Streptomycin may have unique characteristics (e.g., slower degradation or more stable resistance mechanisms) that make it difficult for natural processes to break down the resistant bacteria.
### Discussion
The Sackville Waterfowl Park is more effective at reducing bacteria with Ampicillin resistance than Kanamycin or Streptomycin resistance.
Kanamycin and Streptomycin-resistant bacteria persist in large quantities, suggesting either the park’s natural processes are insufficient to eliminate them or that these bacteria are particularly more stable in this environment.
### Possible natural mechanisms in play.
Natural Filtration is one way by which wetlands reduce population of bacteria moving across them. Wetlands and lagoons often remove bacteria through sedimentation and filtration, which seems to be working well for Ampicillin-resistant bacteria.
Another process is by microbial Competition. Microbial communities in the wetland may be outcompeting Ampicillin-resistant strains but may be less effective against Kanamycin and Streptomycin-resistant bacteria.
Kanamycin and Streptomycin-resistant genes may be more widely distributed or stable, allowing them to persist in the environment even as the water flows through the park.
### Potential Environmental and Public Health Implications
The persistence of Kanamycin and Streptomycin resistance is concerning because it suggests that water leaving the park could still carry antibiotic-resistant bacteria into downstream environments.
If these bacteria enter larger water bodies or agricultural areas, they could pose a risk to human health, wildlife, and the spread of antibiotic resistance.

# Discussion, Ruby
## Ampicillin Trends
Unlike the other antibiotics, very little diversity is seen in Ampicillin, no matter the location of the water sample.
The cream/yellow microbes may have already been resistant to Ampicillin, allowing them to outcompete other microbes in the water sample, or there may have been less resistance of the other microbes to Ampicillin, allowing the cream/yellow microbes to propagate without competition. The darkening of colour of the cream/rust gradient over time looks to be the microbe drying out, since it doesn't further move along the antibiotic gradient after October 28.

## Pink Microbe
This microbe was seen in relatively low abundance (plate coverage) in the Out 3 samples, not including ampicillin. It stuck out because its colour and morphology ("paint splatter) was unique.

# Results and Discussion, Avery

Analyzing the fungi growing on the plates qualitatively.

##Background Research:

In our experiment, a lot of fungal growth was observed. This could be from contamination during innoculation, but could also be from the presence of spores in the water samples, or it could be a combination of both. There were multiple types of fungi observed, but they were not definitively identified because we were unable to open the plates and do further analyses due to potential health hazards. 

Fungal infections are a very prevalent cause of illness today, both in humans but also in many organisms in a variety of ecosystems. Particularly, fungal infections are threatening biodiversity due to mass mortalities and also food security due to fungal infection of crops (Fisher et. al., 2012). Fungal infections are difficult to detect, and are hard to track because spores released to the environment can last for a very long time before infecting an organism (Fisher et. al., 2012). Therefore, globalization is actually a major issue in terms of the spread of spores, because spores can survive transportation across the globe (Fisher et. al., 2012). Because of the negative impact fungal infections are creating in human health and the level of biodiversity, we need ways to combat fungal growth. Unfortunately at the moment, there are not a lot of options to do so. For treating fungal infections, there are only 3 classes of drugs available, many of which have undesirable side effects and do not work properly because of an increase in resistance to drugs (Campoy and Adrio, 2017). 


A question that arises is whether bacterial or fungal infections are more harmful to ones health, would you rather have more bacterial growth or fungal growth? This really depends on the type of bacteria and fungus present. In a study by Khan et. al. (2024), there overall was higher mortality observed in ICU patients that developed fungal infections than those with bacterial infections. Again, these outcomes do vary greatly with the type of bacteria or fungus because some are more dangerous than others. We were unable to open these plates and identify the bacteria and fungi present because of the potential risk of them being harmful, so in this case we cannot say for sure whether or not the fungi and bacteria were dangerous. It is important to consider that when in contact with water like the samples from Waterfowl Park, Sackville NB, there is potential for both bacterial and fungal exposure. 

Fungi are naturally resistant to antibiotics that kill commensal bacteria (which are those naturally occuring in/on the body), and therefore when antibiotics are used there is an increased likelihood of fungal infections (Jiang et al., 2017). With less bacterial growth, there would be more resources available to the fungi. The antibiotics that we tested (ampicillin, kanamycin, streptomycin) all kill commensal bacteria. This would imply that the more bacteria growing on a plate, the less fungal growth would be observed. 

For ampicillin in particular, there are a lot of commensal bacteria that have built up resistance to the antibiotic due to its widespread use in medicine and agriculture (Gjonbalaj et. al., 2020). These bacteria have even been found to degrade ampicillin (Gjonbalaj et. al., 2020), and therefore theoretically this should lead to less fungal growth because there would be less antibiotic present and more commensal bacteria competing for the resources available in the plates. 

In our experiment, this was observed. 

##Taking a closer look at In3:

```{r Calling up Image for In3, October 28, 2024}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Documents/github/antibiotic_resistance/Data/Images/2024_10_28/IMG_2381.jpeg")
```

As can be seen in this image, all of the ampicillin plates exhibit more bacterial growth than the other antibiotic plates.There are also no fungi visible in the ampicillin plates, and there are fungi present in the kanamycin and streptomycin plates. 

##Taking a closer look at Out3:

```{r Calling up Image for Out3, October 28, 2024}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Documents/github/antibiotic_resistance/Data/Images/2024_10_28/IMG_2394.jpeg")
```

A similar trend is observed in this image, all of the ampicillin plates contain lawns of bacterial growth, and no fungi observed. In the kanamycin and streptomycin plates where less bacterial growth is observed, there is fungal growth in every plate. 

These results align with observations made by Jiang et al. (2017), showing that with increased bacterial growth there is less fungal growth. And, with antibiotics preventing bacterial growth there is more likelihood of fungal growth because fungi have natural antibiotic resistance and there is less competition for resources with bacteria if bacterial growth is lower. 

##Fungi-Fungi Inhibition:

In our plates, there are some instances of fungi inhibiting other fungal growth, creating zones of inhibition.

For example, lets take a look at In2:

```{r Calling up Image for In2, October 28, 2024}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Documents/github/antibiotic_resistance/Data/Images/2024_10_28/IMG_2375.jpeg")
```

In this image, you can see in the third streptomycin replicate (bottom right) that there is inhibition of one fungi on the growth of another. The fluffy white fungus has grown around the circular, more beige fungus, leaving what can be described as a zone of inhibition between the two where there is no growth (edges of the two fungi do not extend and meet). 
Here is another example in Out1:

```{r Calling up Image for Out1, October 29, 2024}}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Documents/github/antibiotic_resistance/Data/Images/2024_10_29/IMG_2400.jpeg")
```

In this image, the second and third streptomycin replicates (bottom row, middle and far right) also show fungi-fungi inhibition. There are similar zones of inhibition forming between different fungi growing on these plates. In the second streptomycin replicate, you can see the beige and white fungi will not extend and grow near each other (this image was from the last day of data collection so any extension that could have happened would have at this point), and in the third replicate a similar event can be seen with the beige fungus and the white fungi with green centres. 

What causes this inhibition? 

A possibility is competition for resources, but some fungi are known to produce fungicides, inhibiting the growth of other fungi nearby (Davies et al., 2021). Fungicides have possible applications in agriculture, specifically protecting food stores from fungal infection (Davies et al., 2021). 

##Fungal Growth and location

Upon observation, there is no apparent trend in the location of fungal growth on the plates (in terms of antibiotic concentration). Along with this, there was no apparent trend/difference in fungal growth between the inlet and outlet locations. This makes sense because, as described by Jiang et al. (2017), fungi can have natural resistance to antibiotics. If the antibiotic concentration did play a role in the location of fungal growth (unlikely), no evidence of a trend could imply that significant diffusion of the antibiotic gradient in the plates has occurred. 

##Future Applications

This experiment shows evidence that with increased bacterial growth there is less fungal growth, and this idea has some promising applications in healthcare. A study by Cong et. al., (2023) examines the possibility of using different bacteria to combat fungal infections. Specifically, commensal bacteria are mentioned. Supplementation of these bacteria has been shown to decrease the severity of fungal infections (less fungal growth observed) and in some cases even increase organisms' ability to fight these infections through an production of more macrophages for example (Cong et. al., 2023). The fungal growth in this experiment does exhibit this, the more bacterial growth, the less fungal growth present. This is a promising area of study and is very necessary, as there are not a whole lot of antifungal treatments available and drug resistance is a growing problem (Cong et. al., 2023). 

##Conclusions

In conclusion, while fungi were not the main focus of this experiment and growth was observed as a byproduct of contamination, interesting results were observed when looking at fungal growth. Trends of increased fungal growth with a decrease in bacterial growth were observed, highlighting the prevalence of susceptibility to fungal infection in the presence of antibiotics that kill bacteria. Along with this, some fungi-fungi inhibition was observed in a portion of the plates. There was also no localization of fungal growth due to their natural antibiotic resistance. These non-target observations point out the fact that while bacterial infections may be of great importance, fungal infections are also serious and need attention as there are some major gaps in knowledge present in the field for both medical and environmental applications. The possibility of using bacteria supplementation is a promising future mode of treatment for dangerous fungal infections, which could replace some of the inadequate treatments used today. Implementing such techniques has the potential to save lives and preserve biodiversity.
